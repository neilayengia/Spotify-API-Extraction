Spotify API Data Extraction
This project uses the Spotify API to extract data from a specified playlist, including track names, artist names, and the date each track was added. The extracted data is stored in a CSV file for further analysis or use in other applications.

 Project Overview
The Spotify API offers access to a wide range of music data. This project demonstrates how to authenticate with the Spotify API, extract playlist data, and store it in a structured format (CSV). The project focuses on automating the process of extracting data from a Spotify playlist for use in music-related analysis, visualization, or data science applications.

 Key Objectives:
Authenticate with the Spotify API: Using Client Credentials to obtain an access token.
Extract Playlist Data: Fetch details such as track name, artist, and the date each track was added to a playlist.
Store Data: Save the extracted information in a CSV file for further analysis.
 Techniques & Tools
1. API Interaction
Spotify API Authentication: The project uses the requests library to send a POST request to Spotifyâ€™s authentication endpoint and retrieve an access token.
Playlist Data Extraction: Once authenticated, the project uses the token to query the Spotify API for playlist data and extract relevant details such as track names, artist names, and timestamps.
2. Data Handling
JSON Parsing: The playlist data, returned in JSON format, is parsed and processed using Python's built-in json and requests libraries.
CSV Writing: Extracted data is saved into a CSV file using Python's csv module, creating a structured and easily accessible data file.
 Data Insights
Track Metadata: The project retrieves metadata such as track names and artist names from Spotify playlists.
Timestamps: It captures the date and time each track was added to the playlist, allowing for time-based analysis of playlist changes or trends.
 Libraries & Frameworks
Requests: Used for making HTTP requests to the Spotify API.
CSV: To save the extracted playlist data in CSV format.
JSON: For parsing the API responses from Spotify.
 Results
The playlist data is successfully extracted and stored in a CSV file. This data can be used for further analysis, such as visualizing trends in music playlists, or for building music recommendation systems.
